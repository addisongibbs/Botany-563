The data I chose is ">MT150995.1 Perca flavescens voucher none44 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1) gene, partial cds; mitochondrial"
I chose this because my lab is on fish and I have dealt with yellow perch in the lab.
I ran it through MUSCLE to get an aligned sequence. I chose MUSCLE mostly because it was the only one I could get to work with my data and on my generation of MacBook.
